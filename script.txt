Gandhi was a preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific title Mahatma—meaning "high-souled"—was bestowed on him first in 1914 in South Africa, and became widely used in India in the 1920s. He is internationally honored as the Father of India.
