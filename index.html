        <h3 class="subHeading center">Gandhi's Teachings</h3>

        <p class="datas-quotes center">“If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As
            a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see
            what others do.”</p>

        <p class="datas-quotes center">“A man is but the product of his thoughts. What he thinks, he becomes.”</p>

        <p class="datas-quotes center">“You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops
            of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.”</p>

        <p class="datas-quotes center">“Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.”
        </p>

        <p class="datas-quotes center border">“Your beliefs become your thoughts,
            Your thoughts become your words,
            Your words become your actions,
            Your actions become your habits,
            Your habits become your values,
            Your values become your destiny.”</p>
